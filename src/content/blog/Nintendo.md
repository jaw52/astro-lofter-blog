Nintendo's history is a rich tapestry of innovation, creativity, and resilience. From its beginnings as a playing card company in the 19th century to becoming a global leader in the video game industry, Nintendo has consistently pushed the boundaries of gaming. Here’s a detailed look at the evolution of Nintendo:

### Early History

**Founded:** September 23, 1889

Nintendo was founded by Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto, Japan, originally as a manufacturer of handmade playing cards called Hanafuda. The company experimented with various businesses over the decades, including a taxi service, love hotels, and toy manufacturing. However, it was in the 1970s that Nintendo began to focus on electronic entertainment.

### The Arcade Era and Game & Watch

**1970s-1980s**

In the late 1970s, Nintendo entered the arcade game market. One of its early successes was "Donkey Kong" (1981), created by Shigeru Miyamoto, which introduced the world to the characters Mario and Donkey Kong. Around the same time, Nintendo launched the Game & Watch series, a line of handheld electronic games designed by Gunpei Yokoi. These portable devices were hugely popular and set the stage for Nintendo's future in handheld gaming.
