Sony entered the gaming market with the PlayStation after a failed collaboration with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo. The PS1 was groundbreaking for its time, utilizing CD-ROMs instead of cartridges, which allowed for more storage and better graphics. Iconic games such as "Final Fantasy VII," "Metal Gear Solid," and "Gran Turismo" helped solidify the PS1's place in gaming history. By the end of its lifecycle, it had sold over 100 million units worldwide.

The PS3 initially faced challenges due to its high price and complex architecture, but it eventually found its footing with a strong lineup of games such as "Uncharted," "The Last of Us," and "LittleBigPlanet." By the end of its run, the PS3 sold around 87.4 million units.

The PS4's success was propelled by critically acclaimed exclusives like "Bloodborne," "Horizon Zero Dawn," "God of War," and "Spider-Man." Sony introduced the PlayStation VR to the system, expanding the gaming experience into virtual reality. The PS4 sold over 116 million units worldwide.
